 The web-page is entirely created with HTML and CSS. It`s designed to be structured, visual, and intuitive, so the experience of using it is very simple and straigtforward.
  
  ## The Structure
  
 This Web page contains few main parts: 
  - Home Page
  - Gallery
  - About The Artist
  - Contact
  
  You can defy the Home Page, which is the main and contains cover photo of one of the paintings, the other (Gallery, About The Artist and Contact) are created on the same black and golden background, which provides consistancy and refers to the same styling. 
  There are only three main colors used in this design - Black, Whitesmoky and Golden (#e6cd7a) ![colours](colours.PNG), which provide contrast and visibility. Together with logo and golden elements, compose nice background to colourful pictures in the gallery. 
  There are also two main fonts used: 
  - Alex and Brush
  - Monserrat
