    <h1>Welcome to O-RestArt Site! </h1>
    <p>You`ll find here the collection of acrylic and oil paintings created by Oresta Kinash.</p>
    <p>Every single peace has a unique story behind, and was born with Love and Passion.</p>
    <p>The represented collection is dedicated to Her Majesty Beauty.</p>
    <p>Beauty is among us: it`s in nature, in the waters and the sky, in Universe, but also in small details and usual things which surround us...
        Beauty is in all of us, within us, and we are all magnificent peace of art and creators at the same time. </p>
    <p>There is a thin line between reality and dreams, based on our individual perception.</p>
    <p>This what the real Art is- the language we all can speak and communicate with, and this language doesn`t need translation and explanation, it flows from our heart.</p>
