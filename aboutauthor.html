                <p><span> H</span>i, let me introduce myself. My name is <span>Oresta Kinash </span>. I am a professional choral conductor, vocal teacher, and a self-taught artist. Was born in Ukraine in 1982 in the small town Sambir, Lviv region, in a family of musicians. </p>
    
                <p><span>M</span>y entire life has been devoted to music and singing. For many years I worked as a teacher of music and vocals, and was a leader and conductor of many choirs in Ukraine. My main specialisation is sacred, liturgical music. At the moment live in Warsaw (Poland), where I am working as a conductor and leader of choirs in Ukrainian church in Warsaw. </p>
    
    
                <p><span>S</span>acred music and art always impressed and inspired  me to high thoughts, dreams and unusual deeds. Perhaps that's why painting became my hobby and the beautiful part of artistic and private life. At first it was a desire to create and nothing serious was planned. Over time, drawing grew into a need and became a way of thinking and expressing feelings, mood and dreams. </p>
    
                <p><span>M</span>y preferences are oil and acrylic paintings, but sometimes I also use pastel and watercolour techniques. Love medium and large sizes, because it gives me a freedom of creation. </p>
    
    
                <p><span>T</span>he drawing process also makes me happy , it`s like a deep meditation process. In art, as well in music, high technique skills are very useful, but also the heart and spirit must be present. These components bring sounds and colours to life, they make our inner world rich and our souls immortal.</p>
